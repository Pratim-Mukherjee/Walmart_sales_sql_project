# Walmart_sales_sql_project

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing Walmart sales data from 45 stores to uncover key trends in product performance, customer behavior, and sales strategies. The goal is to optimize sales by identifying top-performing branches, products, and understanding the impact of markdowns and holidays on sales.

**Data:**
The dataset includes historical sales data for three Walmart branches (Mandalay, Yangon, Naypyitaw) and contains 17 columns such as invoice ID, branch, customer type, product line, unit price, quantity, VAT, total sales, and more.

**Key Analyses:**
1. **Product Analysis:** Identify top-performing product lines, sales trends, and strategies to improve low-performing products.
2. **Sales Analysis:** Analyze time-of-day, day-of-week, and monthly trends, along with customer purchase patterns to improve sales strategy.
3. **Customer Analysis:** Segment customers based on purchase behavior, customer type, gender, and revenue generation.

**Approach:**
- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning:** Ensured data quality, handled missing values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Added columns for time of day, day of the week, and month to identify peak sales times and trends.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated sales performance, product popularity, customer segmentation, and VAT contributions.

**Key Insights:**
- Most sales occurred in the afternoon, with higher sales on Fridays.
- Certain product lines performed better than average, while others need optimization.
- Male customers and credit card payments dominated sales trends.
- Branch-wise performance varied, with some branches showing higher COGS and VAT contributions.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis provided insights into sales patterns, product demand, and customer behavior, guiding data-driven strategies for improving sales, profitability, and customer engagement.
